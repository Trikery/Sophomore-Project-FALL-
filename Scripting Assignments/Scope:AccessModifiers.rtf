\f0\fs24 \cf0 As taught by the Unity 3D tutorial.  Scope is a way that C# keeps track of where variables can be used.  This is usually specified by the the curly braces within a data type.  Classes, Functions, etc.  Stating \'93static\'94 at the beginning of a variable will make the variable/function able to be used within other scripts as well.\
Access modifiers are placed at the head of variables or functions and designate whether or not they and/or their parameters can be seen outside of the script.  These are specified by \'93public\'94 (being able to be used) and \'93private\'94 (being not able to be used).\
Another thing that was mentioned was some different types of functions similar to Start and Update, being Awake and Fixed Update.}
