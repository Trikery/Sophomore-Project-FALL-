\f0\fs24 \cf0 Syntax is the fundamental form of Scripting.  Like Grammar in a language.  However with many languages even if you get the grammar a little wrong, people can usually figure out what you\'92re saying, but computers can\'92t.\
Every statement in C# has a type, an identifier, and ends with a semicolon.  Functions always have a type and an identifier, followed by parameter parentheses and brackets.  These are just some of the basic types of Syntax.\
\
Some functions have keywords for their identifiers that specify a very specific function.  Like Start() which activates as soon as the script is active.  Update() which calls once every frame.  OnMouse() which activates every time the user clicks.  These sorts of functions are important for the use of unity.}
