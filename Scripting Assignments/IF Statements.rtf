\f0\fs24 \cf0 On Pluralsight, Joshua talked for a while about float variables.  More specifically at the beginning he discussed conventions.  The basic way of organizing your script so others can find things easily in it.  Like putting curly brackets on equal corresponding tabs, or grouping variables of same types.  also leaving comments helps others to see what parts of the script do what.  Using these sort scripting keeps the code NEAT AND TIDY.\
If statements are a type of logic in scripting.  With an if statement, the computer can test to see IF a statement is true, and if it is, run the code within it\'92s function.  Else statements are tested only  if the initial IF statement is false.  with ELSE IF Statements you can create an if statement with a hierarchy of commands.\
