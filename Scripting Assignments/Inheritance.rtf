\f0\fs24 \cf0 Inheritance is kind of like Hierarchy with folders within other folders or the models within maya that have been child-ed to the parent models.  Any child script will inherit the attributes of the parent but the parent won\'92t have the attributes of the child, so you can alter the parent without actually changing the scripts or components of the child and still the child will inherit transformations or access to the functions of the parent.  This can be useful, for instance if you need to have something affect the parent but not the child, you can set the parent to a separate layer than child.\
There is another access modifier that allows a variable or function to be seen by only the parent and its children.  It is called \'93protected\'94.}
